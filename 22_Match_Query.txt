22. Match Query

Match query is very similar to term query, but match query will use the same text analysis as the searced attribute.

So, for text data type, match query is more suitable as it will use the same text analysis.

Match query can be used for all data types.

POST /[index name]/_search
{
    "query": {
        "match": {
            "gender": "Female"
        }
    },
    "size": 10,
    "from": 0,
    "sort":[
        {
            "username": {
                "order": "desc"
            }
        }
    ]
}

For text data type, Elasticsearch will use StandardAnalyzer, it is a tool to tokenize strings.
