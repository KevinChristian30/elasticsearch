25. Score

By default, everytime we make a query to Elasticsearch, the result of the query will be sorted based on score.

Score is relevancy for search query that we send.

The bigger the score, the more relevant the result is.

The algorithm used is BM25.

To know how a score is calculated, use the Explain API.
