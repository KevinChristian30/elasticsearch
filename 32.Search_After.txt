32. Search After

By default, Elasticsearch limits pagination to 10,000 results.

It is because in a distributed system, there is a Deep Paging Problem.

Usually, there is more than one Elasticsearch node in a cluster.

When we search, Elasticsearch has to query from all nodes, and paginate the results, it is very expensive.

Instead of LIMIT OFFSET pagination, we can use Scroll API.

But, using Search API is no longer recommended because it stores the data in memory for longer than needed.

Instead, use Search After.

POST /[index name]/_search
{
    "size": 100,
    "from": 0, // always search the first page
    "query": {
        "match_all": {
        }
    },
    "sort": [
        {
            "id": {
                "order": "asc"
            }
        }
    ],
    "search_after": [
        "10086" // get from the last response
    ]
}
