4. Data Model

Transitioning from a relational to Elasticsearch is not a simple as transforming a table to an index. In a relational database, we usually perform a database normalization. In Elasticsearch, we need to follow how the client searches data.

Unlike a relational database, Elasticsearch allows insertion without prior schema definition. But, after a schema is formed, the data type of the schema can't be altered. This is different than other NoSQL databases like MongoDB.

Primary Key
===========

In an Elasticsearch document, we need a primary key, that primary key is called _id. We are not allowed to arbitrarilly set the primary key or set composite keys. The _id field is a string.

Schema
======

When creating an index schema in Elasticsearch, there are two point of views:
    - Embedded document:
        {
            "_id": "1",
            "address": {
                "street": "this is an embedded document"
            }
        }
    - Document reference
        {
            "_id": "1",
            "address_id": "1"
        }

Use embedded document if there is a dependency between them. Use document reference if there is no strong dependency between the documents.
