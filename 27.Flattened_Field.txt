27. Flattened Field

By default, every field will be stored as a key in a lucene document.

Elasticsearch has a data type called flattened, that is used as an alternative to store data in a lucene document. 
It takes every value in a child field and store it in a key-value pair as a keyword.

It is suitable for data types with dynamic field to reduce mapping.

PUT /[index nam]/_mapping
{
    "properties": {
        "labels": {
            "type": "flattened"
        }
    }
}

POST /[index name]/customer/_update/[id]
{
    "doc": {
        "labels": {
            "priority": "vip",
            "discount": "10% disount",
            "complaint": "always complaint"
        }
    }
}

In lucene => ["vip", "10% discount", "always complaint"]

POST /[index name]/customer/_update/[id]
{
    "doc": {
        "labels": {
            "priority": "regular",
            "verified": "unverified"
        }
    }
}
