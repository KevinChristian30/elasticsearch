Elasticsearch stores data as an Apache Lucene document (key-value).
But as we know it, Elasticsearch returns the response in a JSON format.

Behind the scenes, Elasticsearch stores the JSON data directly in the lucene document (_source).
So, don't be surprised if the required storage is huge.

By default, Elasticsearch will return everything inside the _source attribute.
But, we can include or exclude an attribute, so we can modify the response.
