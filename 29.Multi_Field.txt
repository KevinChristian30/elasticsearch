29. Multi Field

One of the features of Elasticsearch is multi field.
Multi field is a feature whre we can create multiple field names out of one field.

The added field can be of a different data type.

For example, if we want to have a field "name" and we want to use both text and keyword, we can create multi field like "name" and "name_raw", but we need to make sure that both fields stay the same.

PUT /[index name]/_mapping
{
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "text",
            "fields": {
                "raw": { // can be searched by name.raw
                    "type": "keyword"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
