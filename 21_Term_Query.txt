21. Term Query

Term query is a type of query to find an exact value, like username, product id, price, etc.
Term query is not optimal for searching data with the type text.
That is because text has a specific behaviour called "text analysis" that can make the data incorrect, like auto lowercasing, auto removing symbols, etc.
