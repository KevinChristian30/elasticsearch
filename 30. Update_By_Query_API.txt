30. Update by Query API

When we add a new mapping like a new multi field to an index with data in it, the data in the newly created multifield is not available, we need to do a reindex.

Luckily, there is a away to update the lucene document with the new mapping.

POST /[index name]/_update_by_query
{
    "query": {
        "match_all":{
        }
    }
}
