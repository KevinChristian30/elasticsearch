23. Terms Query

Terms query is similar to IN query in sql.

It won't use text analysis just like term query.

POST /[index name]/_search
{
    "query": {
        "terms": {
            "username": [
                "a",
                "b",
                "c"
            ]
        }
    },
    "size": 10,
    "from": 0,
    "sort":[
        {
            "username": {
                "order": "desc"
            }
        }
    ]
}
