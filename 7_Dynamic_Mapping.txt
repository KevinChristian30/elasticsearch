7. Dynamic Mapping

When creating a table in a relational database, we create the structure first. In Elasticsearch, an index schema is called mapping. By default, mapping is done automatically, a process called dynamic mapping.

But, it is recommended to create a manual or explicit mapping.

JSON Data Type | Elasticsearch Data Type
========================================
null           | no field added
true / false   | boolean
double         | float
long           | long
array          | depends on the first element
string         | date, float, long, text, depends on whether itcan be detected automatically

Get Mapping    -> GET /[index name]/_mapping
Update Mapping -> PUT /[index name]/_mapping (look at docs for body)
