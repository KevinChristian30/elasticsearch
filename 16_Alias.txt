16. Alias

In Elasticsearch, we can't change the schema once it is set, so if we want to make changes, we create a new index instead.

Because of that, the client has to change the index name accordingly. Luckily, we have aliases.

Create Alias -> POST /_aliases
{
    "actions": [
        {
            "add": {
                "index": "orders",
                "alias": "order"
            }
        }
    ]
}
